# Media-Sentiment
Media companies are notorious for their often exaggerated headlines meant to catch the eyes of users. During the height of the 2019-2020 coronavirus pandemic and later the police brutality and race riots, I wanted to determine if media headlines have been hyperbolized more so. 

Focusing only on financial news website, I used Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to gauge the sentiment of various headlines day by day, building a cumulative and daily average of all headlines of the 7 financial sites I chose.

Python's NLTK measures sentiment on a scale of -1 to 1, with -1 indicating the most negative sentiment and 1 indicating the most positive.

From the cumulative and daily averages since in the image below, which represents averages at the end of the day on June 9th, 2020, cumulative and daily averages hovered around the 0.1 mark, a slight positive sentiment, despite the currently dismal conditions:

In order to create a fair comparision, the pandemic and riots must come to an end to determine what sentiment of these sites is during "normal times"

In addition, it is important to note that financial news sites may be more unbiased in their reporting. A future extension of this project would be determining sentiments of popular media sources, such as CNN and CBS, over time.
